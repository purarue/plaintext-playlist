Usage: plainplay [-h] [-] [OPTIONS] [COMMAND [ARGS]]

  An interactive terminal playlist manager; stores playlists as text files
  run without a COMMAND to drop into interactive mode

  A hyphen (-) can be passed with add to instead
	receive filenames from stdin. expects filenames to
	be in the correct format
  (cd to your Music dir and use find for good results)

  e.g.: find somedirectory -name "*.flac" | plainplay - add rock
  
  --auto-confirm can be passed with 'resolve' to automatically
  use the closest match instead of prompting you to choose
  one of the closest matching files to fix broken filepaths

  --abs can be passed with 'm3u' to use absolute
  paths for the generated m3u file, instead of paths
  relative to your Music directory

  e.g. plainplay --abs m3u rock

  [playlist] specifies either the
  name (without the location/.txt extension)
  or the location of one of the playlists

  curplaying using my mpv-currently-playing script at
  https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/mpv-sockets
